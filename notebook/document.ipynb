Ross, All Rights Reserved \\n \\n \\n \\nIn this lab, we’ll explore several aspects of the ICMP protocol:  \\n \\n• ICMP messages generating by the Ping program;  \\n• ICMP messages generated by the Traceroute program;  \\n• the format and contents of an ICMP message.  \\n \\nBefore attacking this lab, you’re encouraged to review the ICMP material in section 4.4.3 \\nof the text1. We present this lab in the context of the Microsoft Windows operating \\nsystem. However, it is straightforward to translate the lab to a Unix or Linux \\nenvironment.  \\n \\n \\n1. ICMP and Ping \\n \\nLet’s begin our ICMP adventure by capturing the packets generated by the Ping program. \\nYou may recall that the Ping program is simple tool that allows anyone (for example, a \\nnetwork administrator) to verify if a host is live or not. The Ping program in the source \\nhost sends a packet to the target IP address; if the target is live, the Ping program in the \\ntarget host responds by sending a packet back to the source host. As you might have \\nguessed (given that this lab is about ICMP), both of these Ping packets are ICMP packets.  \\n \\nDo the following2: \\n                                               \\n1 References to figures and sections are for the 6th edition of our text, Computer Networks, A Top-down \\nApproach, 6th ed., J.F.

Once you have downloaded the trace, you can load it \\ninto Wireshark and view the trace using the File pull down menu, choosing Open, and then selecting the \\nICMP-ethereal-trace-1 trace file.

Then run the Ping \\nprogram by typing return. \\n• When the Ping program terminates, stop the packet capture in Wireshark.  \\n \\nAt the end of the experiment, your Command Prompt Window should look something \\nlike Figure 1. In this example, the source ping program is in Massachusetts and the \\ndestination Ping program is in Hong Kong. From this window we see that the source ping \\nprogram sent 10 query packets and received 10 responses.

ICMP and Traceroute \\n \\n \\nLet’s now continue our ICMP adventure by capturing the packets generated by the \\nTraceroute program. You may recall that the Traceroute program can be used to figure \\nout the path a packet takes from source to destination. Traceroute is discussed in Section \\n1.4 and in Section 4.4 of the text. \\n \\nTraceroute is implemented in different ways in Unix/Linux/MacOS and in Windows. In \\nUnix/Linux, the source sends a series of UDP packets to the target destination using an \\nunlikely destination port number; in Windows, the source sends a series of ICMP packets \\nto the target destination. For both operating systems, the program sends the first packet \\nwith TTL=1, the second packet with TTL=2, and so on. Recall that a router will \\ndecrement a packet’s TTL value as the packet passes through the router. When a packet \\narrives at a router with TTL=1, the router sends an ICMP error packet back to the source. \\nIn the following, we’ll use the native Windows tracert program. A shareware version of a \\nmuch nice Windows Traceroute program is pingplotter (www.pingplotter.com).  We’ll \\nuse pingplotter in our Wireshark IP lab since it provides additional functionality that \\nwe’ll need there. \\n \\nDo the following4: \\n \\n• Let’s begin by opening the Windows Command Prompt application (which can be \\nfound in your Accessories folder).  \\n• Start up the Wireshark packet sniffer, and begin Wireshark packet capture. \\n• The tracert command is in c:\\\\windows\\\\system32, so type either “tracert \\nhostname” or “c:\\\\windows\\\\system32\\\\tracert hostname” in the MS-DOS command \\nline (without quotation marks), where hostname is a host on another continent. \\n                                               \\n4 If you are unable to run Wireshark live on a computer, you can download the zip file \\nhttp://gaia.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/wireshark-traces.zip and extract the file ICMP-ethereal-trace-2. \\nThe traces in this zip file were collected by Wireshark running on one of the author’s computers, while \\nperforming the steps indicated in the Wireshark lab.
